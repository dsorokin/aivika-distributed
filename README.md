A parallel distributed discrete event simulation module for the Aivika library

The represented [Aivika Distributed] [2] package extends the [Aivika Transformers] [1]
package and allows running the parallel distributed discrete event simulations.

It is inspired by ideas of the Time Warp algorithm. The library implements
the optimistic strategy with capabilities of transparent rollbacks.
